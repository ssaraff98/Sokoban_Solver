'Our second heuristic calculates the minimum distance between a box and a unique
'target using Manhattan distance but also takes into account dead positions and
'distance between a player and a box. This level has multiple targets close together
'and boxes relatively close to those targets. It also has many possible dead end
'states. The boxes are accessible to the player in order to compress action sequences
